## Summmary: 
* Work behind the scenes

### JS Behind the scenes
* JS is a hight-level language 
* Garbage-collected. cleaning the memory so we don't need to worry about it
* Interpreted or just-in-time compliled 
* Multi-paradigm, an approach and mindset of structures code, which will direct your coding style and techique
* Prototype-based object-oriented
* First-class functions, functions are simply treated as variables. We can pass them into other functions, and return them functions
* Dynamic, no data type definitions
* Single-threaded, how the JS handles mutiple tasks happening at the same time

### JS Engine and Runtime
* Program that executes javascript code
* JS Engine have: Call Stack and Heap
  * Call Stack: where the code is executed
  * Heap: where objects are stored
* Compilation: Entire code is convertedd into machine code at once, and written to binary file that can be executed by a computer
* Interpretation: Interpreter runs through the souce code and executes it line by line
* JS use Just-inn-time compilation: Entire code is converted into machine code at once, then executed immediatly
