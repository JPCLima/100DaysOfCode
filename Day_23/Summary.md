## Whitch Data Structure to Use?
* Sources of data:
  * From the program itself
  * From UI
  * From external sources
* We colect the collection of data into Data Struture
  * Simple List? -> Arrays or Sets
  * Key/value? -> Objects or Maps
* Arrays Vs Sets:
  * Arrays: When we need to orderred list of values and manipulate data
  * Sets: When we want usnique values, hifgt-performance, remove duplicates
* Object Vs Values: 
  * Objects: More traditional store, easier to write and access values 
  * Objects Use: when we need functions as methods or when working with JSON
  * Maps: Better performace, key can have any datatype, easy to iterate, easy to compute size
  * Maps Use: when we simply need to map key value or when we need keys that are not strings
